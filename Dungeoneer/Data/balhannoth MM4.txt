Dweomersight (Su) A balhannoth can sense the presence
and position of magic auras within 120 feet of itself,
and knows the strength and school of each one. It can
pinpoint the location of any creature with ongoing spells
cast on it, carrying magic items, or otherwise using
magic, and it can notice anything within the area of a
magic effect (including its own dimensional lock aura).
This otherwise functions like blindsense.
Dimensional Lock (Su) As the dimensional lock spell,
20-foot radius centered on the balhannoth, CL 10th.
This effect moves with the creature.
Constrict (Ex) A balhannoth deals 1d8 points of damage
with a successful grapple check, in addition to damage
from its slam attack.
Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a balhannoth must
hit an opponent of up to Large size with a slam attack.
It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action
without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the
grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.
Antimagic Grapple (Su) When a balhannoth grapples an
opponent, all the magical properties of that opponent’s
magic items are suppressed. In addition, a creature
grappled by a balhannoth cannot cast spells or use
spell-like or supernatural abilities. A balhannoth
automatically suppresses magic items by holding or
wearing them.
Camouflage (Ex) A balhannoth’s skin changes color to
match its surroundings. As a result, a balhannoth can
use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain.
Skills A balhannoth has a +15 racial bonus on Hide checks
due to its camouflage ability. It has a +8 racial bonus
on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on
Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.
