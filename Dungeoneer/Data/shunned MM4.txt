Light Sensitivity (Ex) A shunned is dazzled in bright sunlight
or within the radius of a daylight spell.
Magic Strike A shunned’s natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
Disgorge Spiders (Su) As a full-round action that provokes
attacks of opportunity, a shunned can spew a spider
swarm (MM 239) into an adjacent square. Once it has
disgorged spiders, the shunned must wait 1d4 rounds
before using this ability. The shunned controls all such
swarms completely and can instruct each swarm to
attack a particular target. It can redirect a swarm as a
move action.
Wail (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a shunned
can loose a horrid wail. All creatures within 30 feet must
succeed on DC 16 Will saves or become sickened for
1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Skills A shunned has a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and
Spot checks.
It also has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can
always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed
or threatened.
