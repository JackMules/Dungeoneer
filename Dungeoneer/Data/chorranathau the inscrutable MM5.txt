Keen Senses (Ex) See four times as well as a human in
shadowy illumination; see twice as well in normal light.
Telepathy (Su) Chorranathau can communicate telepathically
with any of his exarchs (10-mile range) and with other
willing xorvintaal dragons (100-mile range).
Berserker Power (Su) When Chorranathau is reduced to 186
hit points or fewer, he gains a +5 bonus on attack rolls
and damage rolls.
Divination Immunity (Ex) Nobody can learn about
Chorranathau’s future xorvintaal moves through
divination spells and similar effects. Such effects can still
reveal other information about him.
Constitution Drain (Su) Chorranathau’s bite deals 2d4 points
of Constitution drain (Fortitude DC 28 negates).
40
Dragon Toxin (Su) When Chorranathau hits a creature,
that creature is exposed to dragon toxin and takes 25
points of damage at the start of each of Chorranathau’s
turns. Multiple wounds don’t stack. Magical healing
ends this effect but doesn’t protect against subsequent
exposure. The dragon toxin dissipates 1 round after
Chorranathau dies.
Frightful Presence (Ex) 300-foot radius, 29 HD or fewer, Will
DC 28 negates.
Trip (Ex) If Chorranathau hits with a claw or tail attack, he
can attempt to trip (+33 check modifier) that opponent
as a free action. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot
react to trip Chorranathau.
Crush (Ex) As a standard action, Chorranathau can land
on Large or smaller creatures within in an area equal
to his space. Those creatures take 4d8+16 points of
bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 28
Reflex save or be pinned. Pinned creatures take
4d8+16 points of bludgeoning damage each round
they remain pinned.
Tail Sweep (Ex) As a standard action, Chorranathau can
sweep his tail through a half-circle that has a 30-foot
radius. The sweep deals 2d6+16 points of bludgeoning
damage (Reflex DC 28 half).
Twist of Fate (Su) Chorranathau can spend an immediate
action to produce one of the following effects.
When targeted by a spell that affects one or more
targets (as opposed to an area spell), he can gain
a +10 bonus on the saving throw against that spell. He
subsequently loses his +5 insight bonus on saves for
1d4 rounds.
He can move 30 feet to avoid an area effect, but only
if that movement would take him out of the effect’s area.
If he does so, he cannot move on his next turn.
When Chorranathau could make an attack of
opportunity, he can instead flap his wings and blast
wind at the foe that provoked the attack. The wing flap
functions like a bull rush attempt (+11 bonus on the
opposed check), except that Chorranathau doesn’t move
along with the foe being pushed (though the victim
can still be pushed as far as the maximum distance
Chorranathau could normally bull rush it). If the target is
airborne, it is treated as one size smaller for the purpose
of resolving the opposed check. This immediate action
doesn’t use up Chorranathau’s attack of opportunity.
Devastating Critical (Ex) If Chorranathau confirms a critical
threat with a claw attack, the opponent struck must
succeed on a DC 36 Fortitude saving throw or die
instantly (Draconomicon 68).
Draconic Knowledge (Ex) Chorranathau can make the
equivalent of a bardic knowledge check (PH 28, +14)
to reveal information about an item, event, or locale
(Draconomicon 69).
Overwhelming Critical (Ex) If Chorranathau confirms a
critical threat with a claw attack, he deals an extra 1d6
points of damage with that attack (Draconomicon 72).
Create Exarchs (Sp) Chorranathau can perform an hour-long
ritual to designate a creature as his exarch in the ongoing
great game. Doing so gives the xorvintaal exarch template
(see page 47) to the designated creature.
Sound Imitation (Ex) Chorranathau can mimic any sound he
has heard (Will DC 28 detects the ruse).
