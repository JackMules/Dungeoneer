Fire Aura (Su) If an ember guard is reduced to half of its full 
normal hit points or fewer, it emits a fire aura as flames 
start leaking from its body. Creatures take 1d6 points of 
fire damage at the end of each of the ember guard’s turns 
if they are within 30 feet of it. Creatures within range can 
attempt DC 24 Fortitude saves for half damage. The save 
DC is Constitution-based.
Fortification (Ex) 25% chance to ignore the extra damage 
dealt by a critical hit or sneak attack.
Death Throes (Su) When killed, an ember guard explodes 
in a 60-foot-radius burst that deals 3d6 points of 
bludgeoning damage and 3d6 points of fire damage to 
everything in the area (Reflex DC 24 half). The save DC is 
Constitution-based.
Fire Breath (Su) 30-foot cone, once every 4 rounds, damage 
6d6 fire plus slow, as the spell, for 4 rounds, Reflex DC 24 
half. The save DC is Constitution-based
