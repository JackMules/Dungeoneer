Frightful Presence (Su) A chwidencha can inspire terror by
charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed
on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that
condition as long as they remain within 30 feet of the
chwidencha. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
affected by the same chwidencha’s frightful presence for
24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes
a +4 racial bonus.
Scuttling Charge (Ex) When making a charge, a chwidencha
need not move in a straight line.
Impale (Ex) A chwidencha deals 1d6+9 points of piercing
damage with a successful grapple check.
Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a chwidencha must
hit an opponent of any size with a claw attack. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without
provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple
check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent
on its claws.
Pounce (Ex) If a chwidencha charges a foe, it can make a full
attack.
Magic Strike A chwidencha’s natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.
