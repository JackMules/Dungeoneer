Pain Aura (Su) Living creatures must attempt a DC 21
Fortitude save when they come within 30 feet of a
stitched devil. Those that fail take an extra 1d6 points
of damage whenever they take damage from any other
source while within the pain aura’s area. The save DC is
Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.
When a creature that is affected by multiple pain
auras would take extra damage from the auras, it takes
an extra 1d6 points of damage from one of the auras
affecting it. All other pain auras affecting that creature
cause it to take only 1 extra point of damage apiece. For
example, a creature affected by three pain auras takes
an extra 1d6+2 points of damage each time that creature
takes damage from any other source.
A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected
again by that same stitched devil’s pain aura for 24 hours.
Night hags and lawful evil outsiders are immune to this
aura.
Skills Stitched devils have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks.
A stitched devil can choose to take 10 on Climb checks,
even if rushed or threatened.
