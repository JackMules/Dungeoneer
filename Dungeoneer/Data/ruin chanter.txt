Bardic Music (Su) A ruin chanter has the bardic music ability
of a 12th-level bard (PH 29).
Call Ruin Elemental (Su) Once per week, when a ruin chanter
is aware of interlopers within the ruins it calls home, the
ruin chanter can conjure a ruin elemental (page 134)
after an hour-long ritual. During the ritual, a storm (DMG
94) appropriate for the climate strikes the ruin chanter’s
home. When the ritual is complete, the storm disappears
suddenly and a ruin elemental appears, ready to do the
ruin chanter’s bidding. Since the ruin elemental serves
the ruin chanter until the elemental is destroyed, it’s
possible for a ruin chanter to have more than one ruin
elemental serving it.
Infirmity of Body (Su) By pointing its finger, a ruin chanter
can prematurely age an enemy’s body. Doing so imposes
a –6 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, and
causes the victim’s hair to turn white, skin to wrinkle, and
posture to stoop (Fortitude DC 27 negates). The penalty
lasts for 1 hour or until the victim receives a remove curse
spell. A ruin chanter cannot place both infirmity of body
and infirmity of mind on the same creature. The save
DC is Charisma-based.
Infirmity of Mind (Su) With a wave of its hand, a ruin chanter
can render a creature senile and unable to reliably tell
friend from foe. This ability functions as a confusion spell
(Will DC 27 negates) and makes victims appear elderly
just as infirmity of body does. Infirmity of mind lasts for
1 hour or until the victim receives a remove curse spell.
A ruin chanter cannot place both infirmity of body and
infirmity of mind on the same creature. The save DC is
Charisma-based.
