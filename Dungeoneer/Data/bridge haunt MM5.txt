Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated,
can sense the unnatural presence of a bridge haunt at
a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach
nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain
panicked as long as they are within range.
Rejuvenation (Su) A bridge haunt cannot be permanently
destroyed through combat. The “destroyed” spirit
restores itself and returns to the bridge it haunts in
1d4 days. Taking a haunt more than 1,000 feet from its
bridge can destroy it, as can destroying a haunt’s bridge.
A bridge haunt is laid to rest by taking a piece of the
corporeal remains of its former body, or a possession
important to it in life, and delivering that item to the
place where the creature that became the haunt was
headed before its demise.
Push (Su) A creature damaged by a bridge haunt’s
incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a DC 20
Will save or be telekinetically pushed 10 feet away from
the creature. If a bridge haunt makes a full attack, it
can attack a single creature with both touch attacks,
resolving the push after it is determined if both attacks
deal damage. If both attacks deal damage, the creature
must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or be pushed 20 feet
away. Movement from a push does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.
Bridge Dependent (Ex) Each bridge haunt is mystically
bound to a single bridge and cannot stray more than
1,000 feet from it. If somehow forced to do so, a bridge
haunt is instantly destroyed.
Living Visage (Ex) A bridge haunt seems to be corporeal and
alive until it flies or attacks, when it becomes partially
transparent and appears as the rotting corpse of the
person it was in life.
